in order to do this correctly, copy the raw file from the "blooket hax", favorite/bookmark this before exiting, go to blooket.com/play, log in, go to favorites/bookmarks and you'll see the swaggers gui, right click or hold down for mobile users and click edit, then press Ctrl + A on the URL pressing backspace, then put the copied file in pressing Ctrl + V for keyboard users, save this, go back to favorites, click the swaggers gui again and walla!
